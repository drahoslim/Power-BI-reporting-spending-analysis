# Power-BI-reporting-spending-analysis
Voluntary project of mine in Czech language. Personal finance spending analysis during study abroad, built in Power BI with structured data cleaning and categorization.

Objectives:
The goal was to learn about my spending and learn ways how to reduce costs of living at future trips.

## This project demonstrates my ability to apply gather data, verifying the completeness of the data, establishing for reporting framework, create vizualization techniques.

The final project includes tables of data, a powerpoint presentation and a Microsoft Power BI report.
However due to personal information, I will not be releaseing the data about my personal spending to protect my privacy. Also I have decided to leave out a portion of vizualizations which contain information about the sources of money I used to finance my trip. On top of that, I have also redacted my final takeaways from the reporting regarding spending habits, as I again believe that this information is too private.

Data & Methods
- Data: bank transactions (multiple institutions, cash logs, foreign currency)
- Cleaning: normalization of currencies, manual classification rules (Excel + Power BI)
- Categorization: expense categories (housing, food, travel, leisure, etc.), necessity vs. discretionary
- Tools: Power BI (main), Excel (data prep)
- KPI: % of income spent by category (income not included due to privacy reasons)

Key Learnings
- Handling messy, multi-source personal data
- Building consistent reporting rules to avoid bias in FX transactions
- Visual storytelling with dashboards

Key spending takeaways:
- Meals purchased through the university dining hall provided the best cost-per-calorie ratio compared to other food options
- The analysis highlighted housing as the dominant cost driver
- Travel was representing the most volatile category

**In conclusion, I have reached my goal to gain insights from my spending habits. What also took some time is to figure out an accounting framework which does not skew my foreign transaction data away from reality.**

**However, I realize that I want to be more effective during same steps in future projects, such as using a software to clean and structure the data rather than doing it manually in Microsoft Excel. Furthermore, I would make my projekct more aesthetic if I was reporting to management.**
